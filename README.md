# [DragoNN](http://kundajelab.github.io/dragonn/)

The `dragonn` package implements deep neural networks (DNNs) for predictive modeling of regulatory genomics, feature importance methods such as [DeepLIFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01713) and in-silico mutagenesis to interpret DNNs, and sequence simulations to systematically develop and interpret dragonn models.
