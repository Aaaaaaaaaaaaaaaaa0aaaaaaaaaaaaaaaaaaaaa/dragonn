### Overview of DragoNN

The `dragonn` package implements deep neural networks (DNNs) for predictive modeling of regulatory genomics, feature importance methods such as [DeepLIFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01713) and in-silico mutagenesis to interpret DNNs, and sequence simulations to systematically assess model development and interpretation.

### Installation 

You can install dragonn from [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/kundajelab/dragonn) with:

`conda install -c kundajelab dragonn`
